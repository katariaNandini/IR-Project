For your Information Retrieval (IR) project, you could focus on implementing several core elements from the curriculum. Here’s how you could approach it:

1. **Basic IR Models**:
   - Implement a **vector-space retrieval model** using TF-IDF weighting and cosine similarity to rank documents based on relevance.
   - You could also explore **Boolean retrieval** for simple, keyword-based queries.

2. **Tokenizing, Indexing, and Retrieval**:
   - Build a **tokenizer** to process raw text, including **stop-word removal** and **stemming**.
   - Develop an **inverted index** for efficient document retrieval, which could serve as the backbone of your search engine.
   - Implement efficient sparse vector processing to handle large datasets.

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Calculate performance metrics like **precision**, **recall**, and **F-measure** to assess your model.
   - Consider testing on a **benchmark dataset** if available, or create your own small test set.

4. **Query Operations**:
   - Implement **relevance feedback** to allow users to refine their searches based on previous results.
   - Consider adding **query expansion** for improved recall by using synonyms or related terms.

5. **Text Classification and Clustering**:
   - Use simple text classification methods like **Naïve Bayes** or **K-Nearest Neighbour** to categorize documents.
   - Implement clustering methods like **K-Means** or **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)** to group similar documents, which could enhance retrieval for similar query topics.

6. **Web Search Components**:
   - Simulate aspects of a search engine, including **basic crawling (spidering)** to collect documents from the web.
   - Optionally, explore basic **link analysis** like PageRank for ranking web pages.

7. **Introduction to Semantic Search**:
   - Integrate basic **entity recognition** to identify key entities in documents or queries.
   - Although advanced, you could experiment with a **simple knowledge graph** for semantic search, helping the model understand context beyond keyword matching.

By integrating these components, you’ll have a well-rounded IR project that captures several key topics, reflecting your course’s objectives and learning outcomes. Let me know if you'd like more specific guidance on implementing any of these features!
